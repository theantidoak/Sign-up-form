# Sign-up-form

Entry: 04/06/2022
This project started on 27/05, and originally completed on 03/06. The ojective of this project was the following:

  1. Create a website sign-up form
  2. Use HTML form elements (e.g., form, label, input)
  3. Style those form elements 
  4. Practice using 'relative' and 'absolute' positioning in CSS
  5. Create and use and SVGs
  6. Practice using regex for input patterns
  7. Practice using pseudo elements and pseudo classes
  8. Download and use a font in woff and woff2
  9. Make it compatible with mobile devices (i.e., smaller screen sizes)
  10. Experiment with CSS units
  11. Practice using different CSS selectors


  Unachieved goals: 
    1. Use min(), max(), and clamp()
        Reason: Although attempting to use these at the beginning, they soon became unnecessary.
    2. Use custom properties
        Reason: Simply forgot. 
    3. 'aria' attributes
        Reason: More research.
        Come back and try them out!
  
  Thoughts/What I learned:
    
    Using pseudo classes such as ':first-child', 'nth-child()', 'not()' and 'nth-of-type()' make future edits to HTML more complicated.

    Relying on CSS selectors in combination with pseudo classes can make it difficult to navigate the CSS stylesheet.

    SVGs are great!

    Being able to target a parent element with a CSS selector would be great.

    When using 'position: absolute'  with a 'relative' parent, be careful if another element expands and pushes the 'relative'  parent because the 'absolute' child will get pushed too.

    This was my first attempt at accomodating mobile devices. I read that I should begin with the mobile screen size and then move to the laptop screen size with '@media'. It was fine, but I'm not yet convinced this is the best order.

  What I did poorly:
